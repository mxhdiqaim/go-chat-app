# Go Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built with Go. It features a backend API for user authentication and a WebSocket-based system for handling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients.

The project is designed with a clean, layered architecture, separating concerns between API handling, business logic, and database access.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login endpoints.
- **JWT-based Security**: Protected routes are secured using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
